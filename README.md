🏦 OOPS Banking System in Python

📌 Introduction
This project demonstrates how Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) concepts can be applied to build a Banking System in Python.
Banks manage thousands of accounts daily, and using OOP ensures structured, reusable, secure, and scalable code for operations like deposits, withdrawals, interest handling, and overdrafts.

🚀 Features

💰 Deposit & Withdraw operations

📊 Balance Check

📈 Interest Calculation (Savings Account)

🏦 Overdraft Handling (Current Account)

🔒 Secure Balance Handling with Encapsulation


🧩 OOP Concepts Used

Encapsulation → Secure balance using private variables (__balance)

Inheritance → SavingsAccount & CurrentAccount extend BankAccount

Polymorphism → withdraw() behaves differently in Savings & Current Accounts

Reusability → Easy to add new account types


📖 Example Demonstrations

Ravi deposits 2000 → Balance = 2000

Sneha tries withdrawing 10000 with balance 5000 → ❌ Insufficient Balance

Arjun’s Savings Account 10000 → after 5% interest → Balance = 10500

Priya Current Account 2000 → Withdraw 6000 → Balance = -4000 (Overdraft Allowed)


🌍 Real-World Applications

✔️ Forms the base for Banking Apps
✔️ Can be extended for ATMs, Online Banking Systems
✔️ Demonstrates how data security & error handling improve software reliability
✔️ Provides a scalable foundation for financial applications
